## Description
This assignment was UPENN Module 18: **NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API**
The student had to build an API for a social network web application.  

 The assignment had each student use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, all students were allowed use a JavaScript date library of their choice.  

 This application will not be deployed, thus Insomnia will be used to show examples of the application's API routes.  


## Code Contributors
This was not a group project.  This assignment was completed by each student individually.  



## User Story
